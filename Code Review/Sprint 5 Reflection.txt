Sprint 5 Reflection:

This was definitely one of our most successful and smooth sprints. We were able to finish most of the functionality 
and bug fixes before the deadline of the sprint and we were able to catch up on a lot of issues we had left over 
from previous sprints. Part of what made this sprint successful is that most of the work we needed to do consisted of
bug fixes that we were aware of from the start of the sprint, so we didn't have very many new issues popping up right
at the deadline. Also, people seemed to do their work earlier and stay active during the whole sprint. Since this is
the last sprint, we do not plan on making any changes to our process, but if we were continuing the project we would
keep some of the things we did this time that went well. Specifically, trying to precisely plan out tasks and
responsibility at the start of the sprint and having strict requirements for testing of PR's worked well for us.
