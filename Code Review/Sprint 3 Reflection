Sprint 3 Reflection

This sprint went very well for our team and I am very satisfied with the work that we were able to put together. The two main pillars of the development for this sprint, the collisions and the level generation, both achieved the level of functionality expected for this sprint and can be expanded upon for sprint 4. I feel our team cohesion and communication improved this sprint from sprint 2, with the team doing a better job of issue tracking and flagging. One improvement we can make for the next sprint is to get our functionality running earlier in the sprint cycle, as we were a little late this sprint leading to a slight rush to the deadline.
