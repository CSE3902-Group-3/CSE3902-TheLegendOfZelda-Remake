Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
  Collisions are surely not something that would be easy to understand and use at first glance,
but adding a collision and having a lot of clear comments that explains everything hugely improves
the readability.
  One downside is the naming convention might not be the best. It might be a liitle confusing if it is
the first time looking at this piece of code.
