Sprint number: 3
Name of the .cs file being reviewed: Enemies/SimpleEnemyStateMachine.cs
Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Matt Curie
Specific comments on code quality:
- This class does a good job of separating out some of the functionality shared by many enemies
- It has a little bit of low cohesion since it does some different things, but I think it's okay since its keeping that out of the enemies
- There are a couple small problems with the class, for example line 118 seems to reverse line 116
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
- One change that we actually did make which isn't easily supported here is collision hitboxes which vary in size by enemy. As of right now 
the class is using 16x16 as a placeholder size for all enemies, but if we want to continue using this implementation the class will need to know more information
about the individual enemies
