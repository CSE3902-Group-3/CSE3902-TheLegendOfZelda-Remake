Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: 
- The names of the methods are descriptive
- Logic is only one or two layers deep which is easy to read
- Using IItem as the key of the dictionary instead of Type or and Enum makes it a bit confusing to read through (I'm also not sure if it is correct, but this is a readability review)
