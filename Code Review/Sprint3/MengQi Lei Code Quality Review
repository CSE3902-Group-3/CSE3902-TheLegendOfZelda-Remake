Sprint number: 3
Name of the .cs file being reviewed: LinkUtility.cs
Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Gabe DiFiore
Specific comments on code quality:
  It is a really good choice to have this class to achieve certain functionalities like force Link to walk in a grid.
It simplifies Link class and is also a good start for any future changes of this kind.
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
  If Link should move for a certain distance during attck, this could be easily implemented in this class and the Link class can remain simple and clear.
