Author: Zhengyi Hu

Sprint 2
Files reviewed: Link.cs, LinkStateMachine.cs and LinkStates classes
Review time: Approximately 30 minutes
Comments:
-The readability is great! Classes and methods can be easily understand and implemented in the commands
-There is some confusion between IPlayer and Link. Hope to be solved in later sprint
