Name of the .cs file being reviewed: Command/*.cs

- very good use of the Command design pattern, Execute() functions are all very short and easy to understand with descriptive class/file names
- someone with minimal knowledge of the codebase could fairly easily create their own command
- this goes for all other code reviews, we need to make Game1 a singleton so we aren't passing it into every function
- overall, nice job on readability overall!
