 Sprint 4 Reflection

This sprint, on the whole, went well for our team. Our camera and camera controller classes
are very strong and support the game state changes and room transitions very nicely. Our 
GameState classes are also solid and they added the necessary functionality for the state 
changes. The failure point for this sprint was the interface or HUD classes, as we simply 
ran out of time before we could meet the finish line. This sprint was another mad dash to 
the finish and we look to hopefully break the trend of us running out of time at the 
deadline for each sprint.
