Instructions for writing new levels for the level parser:

1) Use the following json format:
    "Rooms": [
        {
            "RoomNumber": 0,
            "AdjacentRooms": [
                {
                    "RoomNumber": 1,
                    "Direction": "West"
                },
                ...
            ],
            "MapElements": [
                {
                    "ElementType": "Block",
                    "ElementValue": 33,
                    "XLocation": 0,
                    "YLocation": 0
                },
                ...
            ]
        },
        ...
    ]

2) Put bottom layer elements at the start of "MapElements" array:
    - for example put the wall exterior, the doors, then the floor tiles, then the other blocks, then the items / enemies on top

3) Door location in MapElements does not matter, a northern door will always be placed in the same spot, only the type of door and existance of a door matter

4) Blocks are placed in a grid with x values of (0 - 11) and y values of (0 - 6), values less than or greater than these are out of bounds

5) As enemies and items all have a unique size, they must be placed with precise pixel locations
    - viewport size: (1024 x 1024)
    - level view size: (1024 x 704) spanning y vales 320 - 1024
    - thickness of exterior wall: 128
    - block size: 64
