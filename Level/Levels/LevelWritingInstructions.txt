Instructions for writing new levels for the level parser:

1) Use the following json format:
    "Rooms": [
        {
            "RoomNumber": 0,
            "RoomXLocation": 1,
            "RoomYLocation":  0,
            "AdjacentRooms": [
                {
                    "RoomNumber": 1,
                    "Direction": "West"
                },
                ...
            ],
            "Events": [
                {
                    "EventNumber": 0,
                    "XLocation": 8,
                    "YLocation": 6
                },
                ...
            ],
            "MapElements": [
                {
                    "ElementType": "Block",
                    "ElementValue": 33,
                    "XLocation": 0,
                    "YLocation": 0
                },
                ...
            ]
        },
        ...
    ]

2)  There are three types of elements (ElementType): Block, Item, and Enemy. 
    Each has a list of values (ElementValue). Refer to the following dictionaries 
    for the meaning of the values:

    - Block dictionary:
    /**
         * Block Lamda Function Dictionary
         * 
         * FloorTile, 0
         * Wall, 1
         * FishSculpture, 2
         * DragonSculpture, 3
         * BlackTile, 4
         * SandTile, 5
         * BlueTile, 6

         * ImpassibleBlackTile, 38
         * Room12ExteriorCollider, 39
         * Fire, 40
         * FireballFishStatue, 41
         * FireballDragonStatue, 42
         * LavaTile, 43
    */

    - Item dictionary:
    /**
         * Item Lamda Function Dictionary
         * 
         * Arrow, 0
         * Bomb, 1
         * Boomerang, 2
         * Bow, 3
         * Candle, 4
         * Clock, 5
         * Compass, 6

         * HeartContainer, 9
         * Key, 10

         * Potion, 12
         * Rupee, 13
         * Triforce, 14
         * 
    */

    - Enemy dictionary:
    /**
         * Enemy Lamda Function Dictionary
         * 
         * Aquamentus, 0
         * Bat, 1
         * BladeTrap, 2
         * Dodongo, 3
         * GelSmall, 4
         * Goriya, 5
         * Rope, 6
         * Skeleton, 7
         * WallMaster, 8
         * Wizard, 9
         * ZolBig, 10
    */

3) Put bottom layer elements at the start of "MapElements" array:
    - for example put the wall exterior, the doors, then the floor tiles, then the other blocks, then the items / enemies on top

4) Door element location does not matter and they are just placed based the room and type (north, east, south, or west) of door

5) Blocks, items, enemies, and events are placed in a grid with x values (XLocation) of (0 - 11) and y values (YLocation) of (0 - 6), values less than or greater than these are out of bounds

7) RoomXLocation and RoomYLocation places the rooms in a grid, two rooms obviously should not be contained within the same grid element

8) 0 index everything!

9) Events: Add the event number from the dictionary you want for that room and the specific location you want that event to watch or occur.
